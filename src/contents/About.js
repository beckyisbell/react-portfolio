            Hello there. My name is Becky, and if you haven't figured it out already, I enjoy web development and graphic design! I love the process of starting from a simple idea and seeing it blossom into something functional, eye-catching and original! I first began making websites when I was in middle school. I taught myself most of what I know, and from there I just kept with it, eventually going on to help big-label bands (like <a href="https://lifehousemusic.com/" target="new">Lifehouse</a> in 2009) run their websites.
</p><p>
            I am currently in school working towards a degree in Web Development to further my skills. Once I am done with my Associates in Web Development in Summer 2020, I plan on getting my Bachelor's Degree in Communications at Appalachian State University. I currently work as an escalation specialist at Cisco Systems in RTP - North Carolina, and I enjoy being around technology all day, every day and continuously learning new things!
</p><p>
            In my free time, I enjoy learning new web design techniques, working on my <a href="http://selflovescript.com/" target="new">self-care blog</a>, helping out with <a href="https://animalrescue.net/">Independent Animal Rescue</a> Facebook events, spending time with friends and family, and being outdoors with my dog. If you enjoy my work displayed here on this portfolio, make sure you reach out to me to see what I can do for you! If you're interested in learning more or have inquiries about my designs, please contact me at <b>beckyisbell92@gmail.com</b>. I look forward to working with you and helping you create the design of your dreams.
